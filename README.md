1. Above is the code to validate a mobile number in python using nested if-else.
2. In the first if else we check if the number is greater or less than 10 .
3. If it is not then we print the error message,
4. if it is exact 10 digits we go to the next step in validation.
5. we successfully pass the 10 digit mobile number validation.
6. we check if the first digit in the number is 7 or 8 or 9 .
7. if it is not then we throw an error message and if it is then next validation.
8.  I have used to try and except in the try I am converting the num to int if it fails
9.  To convert because of any characters in number.
10.  Then it will go in the except where the error message will show.
